## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A saturated crimson (#E62946) to evoke passion and history, while avoiding clichéd sporting greens.
- Background color: A very light gray (#F0EDED) offering a vintage feel.
- Accent color: A subdued gold (#D4A770), lighter than the primary to contrast well. Meant to hint at trophies and historical prestige.
- Font pairing: 'Playfair' (serif) for headlines to communicate high quality and style; 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body copy for modern readability.
- Use minimalist, line-based icons that reflect retro football aesthetics. For example, a football, a jersey, or a stadium outline.
- Employ a clean, grid-based layout with generous whitespace to provide a modern feel while still maintaining focus on a retro aesthetic.
- Incorporate subtle scrolling animations to bring the landing page to life as the user explores the site.  Use for section reveals.
